# 🏡 House Price Analysis and Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Analyze house price data to identify key pricing factors, detect outliers, and build a model to predict future prices.

---

## 📁 Project Contents

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data cleaning and exploration
  - Feature engineering
  - Outlier analysis
  - Predictive modeling using machine learning
  - Future price prediction
- `zameen-updated.csv`: The dataset used for analysis

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies  
   - Visualized distributions and relationships between price and features

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new useful features  
   - Encoded categorical variables for modeling

3. **Outlier Analysis**  
   - Detected and investigated extreme high/low priced properties

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Trained and evaluated models like Linear Regression and Random Forest  
   - Used performance metrics like R² and MSE

5. **Future Price Prediction**  
   - Predicted prices for hypothetical houses using the trained model
